    <h2>Instructor-Led Curriculum</h2>

      <h3>Meet Your Instructor</h3>
      <p>My name is <strong>Pat Vihtelic</strong> and I'm the founder of OfficeGeek.  I have seen firsthand how important Microsoft Office products can be to productivity.  Hours and resources can be wasted with the wrong approach.  I previously worked at William Blair and Company doing technology investment banking where I relied on Microsoft Office products more than my fair share.  Before that, I peer tutored for the Indiana Unviersity 200 level Excel business honors course, so I became familiar with all Excel had to offer before working with it professionally.  Knowing what Excel is capable of at an early stage in learning helped tremendously with problems I encountered later.</p>
      <p>I can show you or your employees how to properly use Microsoft Office products with real professional context.  I have trained, tutored and been taught myself.  I try to bring a fresh approach to an often boring topic.  Please feel free to contact me at patrick.vihtelic@gmail.com with any questions.</p>
